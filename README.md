MindWave Cat Ears
=================

This is an arduino sketch to [make a pair of ears move according to brain waves][1]. 

It's a work in progress. I'll be announcing progress and updates on [my blog][4] and on [twitter](http://twitter.com/paperbits).

Installation
------------

Open these sketches in the Arduino IDE and upload to an arduino board. 

### CAUTION ###

These sketches been tested in Arduino v.0022 alpha.  
They have _not_ been tested in Arduino 1.0 yet. 

Usage
-----

See the [Assembly Instructions][3] for full usage and instructions. 

### CAUTION ###

As of Friday, November 25, 2011 the assembly instructions are only partially written. 

Resources
---------

* [Printable CAD files][2] on thingiverse.com  
  STL files, printable on a makerbot. Editable Solidworks files still being compiled.

* [Assembly Instructions][3] on makeprojects.com  
  Also a work in progress, I'm waiting for a new set of parts to do a full set of build photos.  

TODO  
----

* change the servo min/max variable setup so that it's easier to tune  
* change the ear wiggle functions to make them easier to tune  
* finish the [build instructions][3]  
* test the code on arduino 1.0  
* port the code to the [Arduino Brain Library](http://github.com/kitschpatrol/Arduino-Brain-Library/).  
* generalize the code to make it easier to make non-feline versions and animations of the ears
* make the ear movement more fluid and less jerky.
